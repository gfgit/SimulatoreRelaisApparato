# Interlocking Relay Simulator

[Versione in italiano](README_it.md)

A cross-platform C++ application with Qt GUI
for understanding and simulating electric circuits in
Italian Railways electrical interlocking systems.

You can draw and save electrical circuits which look similar
to real circuits drawings done on paper.

Then you can animate circuits and play with them to better
understand the logic conditions they implement.

*Currently tested on Ubuntu.*
